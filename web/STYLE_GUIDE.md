# Style Guide
- Use [MOIST](https://medium.com/@slavik57/why-should-you-write-moist-code-8d127e2c0075) code whenever possible.
- Code should be simple and easy to read
- Use tabs for indentation
- Use camelCase for naming variables, functions, and classes
- Use PascalCase for naming components
- Use kebab-case for naming files
- When creating components avoid hardcoding and make them as reusable as possible
- Keep components as small as possible. If you need to add a lot of functionality, consider breaking it into smaller components
    - If you start repeating yourself a lot, consider using components ._.

## CSS
- Use the [BEM](https://en.bem.info/methodology/quick-start/) methodology for naming classes.
- Don't use tailwind css
- Keep your styles accessible
- idk how to put this but use DRY code but for css. for example instead of creating dark variants of every "success" "warning" "error" button, just use a Darkness filter.
